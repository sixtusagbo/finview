# FinView

A clean and user-friendly interface for visualizing and analyzing AAPL's (Apple) annual income statements. The frontend is designed to filter key metrics like revenue, net income, gross profit, EPS (Earnings Per Share), and operating income, providing actionable financial insights. Built with modern web technologies for a seamless user experience.

I built this project with React, TypeScript, Vite and TailwindCSS.
